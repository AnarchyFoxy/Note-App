Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the "note_app.py" file using the cd command.

Run the script using the Python interpreter by typing the following command:

python note_app.py <command> [options]

Replace <command> with the desired command (e.g., "new", "add", "show", "open", "delete"), and [options] with any additional options you want to pass (e.g., "-h" for help, "-v" for verbose, "-l NUM" for the limit, etc.).

For example, to add a new note, you can use the following command:


python note_app.py add

To show all saved notes, you can use:

python note_app.py show

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and it is accessible from the command prompt or terminal. You can check the Python version by running the command python --version or python3 --version. If you see the version number, Python is installed and ready to use. If not, you need to install Python before running the script.
